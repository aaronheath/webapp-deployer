# Webapp Deployer

A pretty simple continious integration webapp deployer that I use on one of my servers.

## Setup

1. Clone Repository

Clone the repository to the server where you want deployments to be made.

`git clone https://github.com/aaronheath/webapp-deployer.git`

2. Install Composer Packages

We now need to install the composer packages and initilise the project.

`composer run-script setup`
